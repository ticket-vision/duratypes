## Overview

This document contains the results of our security review of duratypes dependencies.

## Current Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **pydantic**: 2.11.7
  - Status: ✅ Up-to-date, no known vulnerabilities
  - Purpose: Core validation and type system
  - Security: Well-maintained, active security monitoring

### Development Dependencies
- **pytest**: 8.4.1 - ✅ Current, no known vulnerabilities
- **pytest-cov**: 6.2.1 - ✅ Current, no known vulnerabilities  
- **hypothesis**: 6.137.1 - ✅ Current, no known vulnerabilities

- **black**: 25.1.0 - ✅ Current, no known vulnerabilities
- **pre-commit**: 4.2.0 - ✅ Current, no known vulnerabilities

## Security Assessment

### Risk Level: LOW ✅

All dependencies are:
- Recent versions with active maintenance
- No known security vulnerabilities identified
- From trusted, well-maintained projects
- Minimal attack surface (only 1 runtime dependency)

### Recommendations

1. **Continue Regular Updates**: Monitor for new releases monthly
2. **Automated Scanning**: Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Maintain the current minimal dependency approach
4. **Version Pinning**: Consider more specific version constraints for production use

## Monitoring Strategy

- **Monthly Reviews**: Check for dependency updates and security advisories
- **Automated Alerts**: Set up GitHub Dependabot for automated security updates
- **CI Integration**: Add security scanning to the CI pipeline

## Next Review Date
